# PLAN

This is going to be the plan for this particular application

## Features

- [ ] get authentication with oauth (because I dont know it)
- [ ] use drizzle for database (Because I've never seen it)
- [ ] use a AWS S3 for storage (I've never used it)
- [ ] use sqlite (because it's free)

## Todos

- [ ] create a login page
- [ ] a place to upload a photo
- [ ] Have a model for the database
- [ ] a place to view the photo
- [ ] Maybe when a photo is uploaded, it will create a small version and large version of the photo. maybe the small version can have a watermark
